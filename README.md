A Go program using the Gin framework to create an API endpoint that fetches an RSS feed from Some Persian News (see them in below) Website and returns it as JSON.

# Rss API Integration

The primary goal is to provide a tool that gathers up-to-date news content and sends it in a structured JSON format to individuals or systems that require this information.
